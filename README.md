# Machine Learning Engineer - Capstone Project
Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program - Capstone Project

## Object
  This project aims at a real-life data science task that was provided by partners like Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics.
Analyzes of the demographic data of customers of a sales company, where they are located in Germany and comparing with demographic information of the general population, will be carried out.
Unsupervised learning techniques will be used to segment customers, identifying groups of the population that best describe the company's main customer base. In a third set of data, supervised
learning techniques will be applied to predict which people are most likely to order by mail who may become your customers.

  The main idea of this project is to put into practice all the machine learning and software engineer knowledge learned during the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program.
